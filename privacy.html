            DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
            mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
            version of this privacy notice.</p>
